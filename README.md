# Gourmet Delight  
**Where Flavor Meets Function**

## Problem Statement

Most local restaurants still rely on outdated or poorly designed websites. These digital front doors are often:

- Visually unappealing or inconsistent with the brand
- Difficult to navigate on mobile devices
- Lacking essential features like menus, reservations, and contact options

As a result, potential customers bounce, and businesses lose visibility and revenue.

## Our Vision: Gourmet Delight

**Gourmet Delight** is a beautifully designed, fully responsive website template tailored specifically for restaurants and cafes looking to modernize their online presence.

Our goal was simple: replicate the elegance of fine dining through intuitive design, clean code, and engaging interactivity.
